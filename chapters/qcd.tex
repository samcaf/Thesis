The discovery of hadronic jets in high energy particle collisions is one of the most important milestones in human understanding of the strong nuclear force and of the microscopic universe.
%
Jets were originally predicted \cite{}, and later measured \cite{}, as collimated sprays of hadronic radiation produced in high energy collisions involving the strong interaction.
%
The explosion of experimental, phenomenological, and theoretical study of jets that followed has solidified Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as our fundamental theory of the strong nuclear force.
%
The use of jets as experimental and theoretical proxies for quarks and gluons -- the fundamental particles described by QCD -- has facilitated an unprecedented study and understanding of the physical properties of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) and of the mathematical structure of quantum field theory (QFT).
%
It is not an exaggeration to say that the discovery of jets has been one of the most important developments in the history of our study of the natural world.

\sam{Several cartoons associated with the concepts in the paper.}

Explain concepts easily and explain why they are hard.

Mention split between perturbative and non-perturbative.

Mention what I don't mention and why.
