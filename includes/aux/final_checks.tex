    \item
    No files in temp folders;

    \item
    Consistency for
    \begin{itemize}
	\item
	high energy (low energy) vs. high-energy (low-energy)

	\item
	``nonperturbative'' to ``non-perturbative''

	\item
	``subjet'' to ``sub-jet''.

	\item
	\(\beta\) function \(\to\) beta function (so people can find with ctr-f)

	\item
	``plus-function'' to ``plus-distribution''

	\item \(d\) to \(\dd\) in integrals
